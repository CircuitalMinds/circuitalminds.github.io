  My best experience as a professional, and also as a personal one,
  is to understand that any human being in the right conditions
  can be able to train in a self-taught way, learn and develop skills
  to wait if he wants to; And self-motivation is a skill that certainly
  should not be lacking. The main key to achieve this, and in general
  for any type of objective, is discipline. Getting it is the most important
  step, and the next is to maintain it.

  Although it sounds trivial, in reality, understanding its importance makes
  a difference since to achieve it it may be complicated for some and I include
  myself in this case. But it is possible, since a few years ago when I started
  my studies in the degree of Chemical Engineering, I could not understand the most
  basic knowledge of algebra, but my enthusiasm and my interest motivated me to try it,
  although initially my results were stumbling blocks and exams with rating of zero. 
  Even so, I never backtracked and the end result was my degree in chemical engineering,
  and almost a degree in mathematics; however, I got a masters degree in
  mathematical science instead. There is no better proof that almost anything is possible
  if we start with initiative, and perseverance until we achieve discipline. 
  
  And of course, we are all interested in knowing what kind of music you listen to.
  I share my favorite YouTube list, enjoy it!
